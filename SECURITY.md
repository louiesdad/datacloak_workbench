# Security Policy

## Overview

DataCloak Sentiment Workbench is built with security and privacy as core principles. This document outlines our security policies, procedures, and the comprehensive security features implemented in the application.

## üîí Security Architecture

### Privacy-First Design
- **Offline Processing**: All data processing happens locally - no data leaves your machine
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Complete functionality without internet connectivity
- **Local Storage Only**: Data stored in local databases (SQLite + DuckDB)
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256-CBC encryption for sensitive data

### Security Package (`@dsw/security`)

Our comprehensive security package provides enterprise-grade privacy protection:

#### üîç PII Detection & Masking
- **DataCloak Integration**: Native FFI bridge with DataCloak binary
- **High-Fidelity Mock**: Production-quality fallback when binary unavailable
- **Advanced Detection**: Supports emails, phone numbers, SSNs, credit cards, addresses, names, dates
- **Context-Aware Masking**: Intelligent masking strategies preserving data utility

#### üîë Secure Key Management
- **OS Keychain Integration**: 
  - macOS: Security framework (Keychain Services)
  - Windows: Credential Manager
  - Linux: Secure encrypted file storage
- **AES-256-CBC Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption with proper IV handling
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key lifecycle management

```

## üîê Data Protection

### Data Classification
- **Sensitive Data**: PII, financial information, health records
- **Internal Data**: Application state, user preferences, logs
- **Public Data**: Non-sensitive analysis results, anonymized reports

### Protection Measures
- **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC for all sensitive data at rest
- **Masking**: Irreversible PII masking before any processing
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive operations
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all data access

### Data Lifecycle
1. **Ingestion**: Immediate PII detection and flagging
2. **Processing**: Masked data processing with original data protection
3. **Storage**: Encrypted storage with secure key management
4. **Export**: Only masked/anonymized data in exports
5. **Deletion**: Secure wipe of sensitive data when no longer needed

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Event Categories
- **Critical**: Data breach, unauthorized access, system compromise
- **High**: PII exposure, compliance violation, encryption failure
- **Medium**: Performance degradation, monitoring alert, configuration issue
- **Low**: Routine security event, informational alert

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate isolation of affected components
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and evidence collection
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and security enhancement
6. **Reporting**: Incident documentation and lessons learned
