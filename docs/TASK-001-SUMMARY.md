# TASK-001: DataCloak Dependency and Setup - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Installed DataCloak Library
- Cloned DataCloak repository from https://github.com/louiesdad/datacloak.git
- Built DataCloak core library (libdatacloak_core.dylib)
- Built DataCloak CLI binary

### 2. Set up Rust Toolchain
- Verified Rust installation (rustc 1.87.0)
- Successfully compiled DataCloak with all dependencies

### 3. Configured FFI Bindings
- Created wrapper script at `/packages/security/bin/datacloak-wrapper.js` for JSON-based communication
- Updated `native-bridge.ts` to support both native binaries and JS wrapper
- Fixed TypeScript compilation issues in the native bridge

### 4. Created DataCloak Service Wrapper
- Implemented `DataCloakService` at `/packages/backend/src/services/datacloak.service.ts`
- Added mock bridge implementation for development
- Supports all required methods:
  - `detectPII()` - Detects PII in text
  - `maskText()` - Masks detected PII
  - `detectPIIBatch()` - Batch PII detection
  - `maskTextBatch()` - Batch text masking
  - `auditSecurity()` - Security audit functionality

### 5. Wrote Integration Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite at `/packages/backend/src/tests/integration/datacloak.test.ts`
- All 18 tests passing
- Tests cover:
  - Service initialization
  - PII detection (email, phone, SSN, credit cards)
  - Text masking
  - Batch operations
  - Error handling
  - Performance

### 6. Documentation
- Created DataCloak API documentation at `/docs/DATACLOAK-API.md`
- Documented all service methods, parameters, and return types
- Included performance characteristics and security features
- Added troubleshooting guide

## Configuration Added

### Environment Variables
```
DATACLOAK_API_KEY=
DATACLOAK_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
DATACLOAK_TIMEOUT=30000
DATACLOAK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
DATACLOAK_USE_MOCK=false
```

### Backend Configuration
- Updated `/packages/backend/src/config/env.ts` with DataCloak configuration
- Updated `.env.example` with DataCloak environment variables

## Current Implementation Status

- ✅ DataCloak binary compiled and available
- ✅ Mock implementation working for development
- ✅ Service wrapper with full API coverage
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ⚠️ Using mock implementation until full FFI integration

## Next Steps (for TASK-003)

1. Replace mock regex patterns with actual DataCloak binary calls
2. Implement proper FFI using node-ffi-napi or neon bindings
3. Connect to real DataCloak ML-powered PII detection
4. Implement confidence scoring from DataCloak
5. Update tests to work with real DataCloak implementation

## Performance Metrics

Current mock implementation performance:
- PII Detection: ~0.17ms average
- Text Masking: ~0.05ms average
- Batch operations: <500ms for 10 concurrent requests

## Notes

- The DataCloak binary is ready at `/packages/security/bin/macos/datacloak`
- The wrapper script provides a bridge between Node.js and the CLI
- The service is designed to easily switch between mock and real implementations
- All interfaces are properly typed for TypeScript safety
