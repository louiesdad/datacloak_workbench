- **Day 6**: Profile API complete (T2) → Field inference integration (T3)

## Risk Items
- **Day 2**: 50GB streaming test (T2) - Validates chunking strategy
- **Day 2**: Large file drag-drop (T1) - ✅ COMPLETED: Uses Electron main process
- **Day 5**: DataCloak FFI Windows/macOS (T4) - Binary compatibility check
- **Day 6**: DuckDB 8GB RAM test (T2) - May need chunked DB files
