# Task Distribution Guide

## How to Distribute Tasks to Your Development Team

### 1. Team Meeting Preparation
Share these documents with all developers before the kickoff meeting:
- `/docs/CLAUDE_tdd_reference_guide.md` - TDD methodology guide
- `/docs/prd/multi-field-differential-prd.md` - Product requirements
- `/docs/DEVELOPER_TDD_TASKS.md` - Complete task assignments

### 2. Developer Assignment Options

#### Option A: Self-Selection
Let developers choose their preferred area based on:
- Technical expertise (backend, frontend, data science)
- Interest in the feature area
- Current workload

#### Option B: Direct Assignment
Assign based on:
- **Dev 1**: Your most experienced backend developer (core system changes)
- **Dev 2**: Developer with API and real-time experience
- **Dev 3**: Frontend specialist with UX sensibility
- **Dev 4**: Developer interested in business logic and integrations
- **Dev 5**: Someone with data science or analytics background
- **Dev 6**: Developer who enjoys statistical analysis
- **Dev 7**: QA-minded developer who writes good tests
- **Dev 8**: DevOps or infrastructure-focused developer

#### Option C: Pair Programming
Assign 2 developers per section for:
- Faster delivery
- Knowledge sharing
- Better test coverage
- One writes tests, one implements

### 3. Communication Channels

Create dedicated channels for:
```
#datacloak-tdd-dev - General development discussion
#datacloak-integration - Integration point coordination
#datacloak-standup - Daily progress updates
#datacloak-help - TDD questions and assistance
```

### 4. Kickoff Meeting Agenda

1. **TDD Overview** (30 min)
   - Review TDD principles
   - Show Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Demonstrate with simple example

2. **Product Overview** (30 min)
   - Walk through PRD priorities
   - Explain user journey
   - Show expected outcomes

3. **Task Assignment** (30 min)
   - Present developer sections
   - Allow questions
   - Finalize assignments

4. **Integration Planning** (30 min)
   - Identify touchpoints
   - Schedule sync meetings
   - Define interfaces

### 5. Tracking Progress

#### Daily Standups
Each developer reports:
- What tests they wrote yesterday
- What tests they're writing today
- Any blockers or integration needs

#### Weekly Demo
- Each developer demos their working tests
- Show implementation progress
- Discuss refactoring done

#### Metrics to Track
- Tests written per day
- Test coverage percentage
- Red-to-Green cycle time
- Integration test status

### 6. Quick Reference Card for Developers

Print or share this:

```
TDD QUICK REFERENCE
==================
1. Write a failing test (RED)
2. Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor the code (REFACTOR)
4. Repeat

COMMIT PATTERN
=============
git commit -m "RED: Add test for [feature]"
git commit -m "GREEN: Implement [feature]"
git commit -m "REFACTOR: Clean up [feature]"

YOUR ASSIGNMENT
==============
Developer #: _____
Section: _________________
First test due: __________
Integration partner: _____

HELP RESOURCES
=============
TDD Guide: /docs/CLAUDE_tdd_reference_guide.md
PRD: /docs/prd/multi-field-differential-prd.md
Tasks: /docs/DEVELOPER_TDD_TASKS.md
Slack: #datacloak-help
```

### 7. First Week Schedule

**Monday**: Kickoff meeting, assignments, TDD training
**Tuesday**: Everyone writes first 3 failing tests
**Wednesday**: Make tests pass, daily standup
**Thursday**: Continue implementation, identify integration needs
**Friday**: Demo working tests, plan next week

### 8. Common Questions to Address

**Q: What if I can't think of a test?**
A: Start with the simplest happy path, then add edge cases

**Q: How detailed should tests be?**
A: Test behavior, not implementation. Focus on what, not how.

**Q: When do we integrate?**
A: After each developer has basic tests passing for their core features

**Q: What test framework should we use?**
A: Use the existing framework in the project. If none exists, agree on one as a team.

### 9. Success Criteria

Each developer should:
- [ ] Read all prerequisite documents
- [ ] Write tests BEFORE implementation
- [ ] Maintain or increase code coverage
- [ ] Coordinate on integration points
- [ ] Demo working features weekly

### 10. Distribution Checklist

- [ ] Share documents with team
- [ ] Schedule kickoff meeting
- [ ] Set up communication channels
- [ ] Assign developers to sections
- [ ] Create tracking system
- [ ] Schedule daily standups
- [ ] Plan first integration milestone
