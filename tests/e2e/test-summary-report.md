# E2E Test Summary Report

## Test Execution Summary
- **Date**: 2025-06-20
- **Total Tests**: 75
- **Passed**: 34 (45.3%)
- **Failed**: 41 (54.7%)
- **Success Rate**: 45.3%

## Progress Made

### Fixed Issues
1. **SQLite Connection Pool Timeouts**: Increased timeout from 5s to 30s and pool size from 5 to 10
2. **Connection Leaks**: Fixed in real-time sentiment feed service by using `withSQLiteConnection`
3. **Module Initialization**: Fixed TransformPersistenceService initialization blocking
4. **Test Selectors**: Updated to match actual UI structure
5. **Mock Server**: Switched from MSW to Playwright's native request interception for browser tests

### Key Improvements
- File upload tests now working with proper request mocking
- UI element selectors updated to match actual rendered DOM
- Backend connection issues resolved

## Current Status

### Working Features
- File upload functionality
- Data profile display
- PII detection display
- Basic navigation between workflow steps

### Remaining Issues
1. **Test Environment Setup**: Some tests still failing due to mock server conflicts
2. **Complex Workflows**: Multi-step workflows need proper state management
3. **WebSocket Tests**: Real-time features need WebSocket mocking
4. **Performance Tests**: Need proper metrics collection setup

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete migration of all tests to use Playwright request interception
2. Add proper wait conditions for async operations
3. Fix remaining selector mismatches

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement proper test data factories
2. Add visual regression testing
3. Create test environment configuration profiles
4. Add performance benchmarking
