# Skip Transform Error Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing two issues when clicking "Skip Transform" in the workflow:

1. **Initial Issue (Fixed)**: Application crash with error:
```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function 
(for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component 
from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports. 
Check the render method of 'ForwardRef'.
```

2. **Secondary Issue (Fixed)**: Temporary error screen flash showing "No Datasets Available" before the application recovers and shows the correct content.

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Component Import Error
The error was caused by incorrect usage of `React.ErrorBoundary` in `LazyComponents.tsx`. 
React doesn't provide an ErrorBoundary component directly - it must be implemented as a 
class component.

### Issue 2: State Synchronization
When clicking "Skip Transform", the workflow immediately navigated to the 'configure' step, but the `selectedDataset` state was momentarily null/undefined, causing the RunWizard to receive an empty datasets array and show an error state briefly.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: ErrorBoundary Import
1. Added import for the locally defined ErrorBoundary component:
   ```typescript
   import { ErrorBoundary } from './ErrorBoundary';
   ```

2. Changed the usage from `React.ErrorBoundary` to `ErrorBoundary`:
   ```typescript
   // Before (incorrect):
   <React.ErrorBoundary ...>
   
   // After (correct):
   <ErrorBoundary ...>
   ```

### Fix 2: State Management in WorkflowManager
1. **Enhanced handleSkipTransform**: Ensures a dataset is selected before navigation:
   ```typescript
   // Ensure we have a selected dataset before proceeding
   if (!state.selectedDataset && state.fileProfiles.length > 0) {
     const dataset = createDatasetFromProfile(state.fileProfiles[0]);
     setSelectedDataset(dataset);
   }
   ```

2. **Improved configure step rendering**: Creates datasets on-the-fly if needed:
   ```typescript
   const datasetsForWizard = state.selectedDataset 
     ? [state.selectedDataset] 
     : state.fileProfiles.length > 0 
       ? [createDatasetFromProfile(state.fileProfiles[0])]
       : [];
   ```

3. **Added loading state**: Prevents flash of error content during state transitions:
   ```typescript
   if (state.fileProfiles.length > 0 && datasetsForWizard.length === 0) {
     return <LoadingState />;
   }
   ```

## Files Modified
- `/packages/web-ui/src/components/LazyComponents.tsx` - Fixed ErrorBoundary import
- `/packages/web-ui/src/components/WorkflowManager.tsx` - Enhanced state management and transitions
- `/packages/web-ui/src/components/__tests__/WorkflowManager.skipTransform.test.tsx` - Added comprehensive tests

## How It Works
1. When "Skip Transform" is clicked, the workflow:
   - Checks if a dataset is already selected
   - If not, creates one from the file profile data
   - Sets the selected dataset in state
   - Then navigates to the 'configure' step
2. The configure step:
   - Checks for available datasets
   - Creates them on-the-fly if needed from file profiles
   - Shows a loading state if data is being prepared
   - Only renders RunWizard when datasets are ready
3. The RunWizard component:
   - Has a guard clause for empty datasets
   - Shows a proper empty state instead of crashing
   - Auto-advances through steps when data is available

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Start the application
2. Upload a data file
3. Complete the profile step
4. Click "Skip Transform" button
5. The application should:
   - Navigate smoothly to the configuration step
   - Not show any error screens or flashes
   - Display the RunWizard with the correct dataset loaded

## Prevention
- Always ensure required state is available before navigation
- Use loading states during async operations or state transitions
- Implement proper guard clauses in components that depend on external data
- Consider using state machines for complex workflows to prevent invalid states
