**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Verifies parallel processing achieves at least 2x performance improvement

- Validates rate limiting doesn't exceed configured thresholds
- Ensures cache hits for duplicate texts reduce processing time
- Confirms partial failures don't block entire batch

### 2. Predictive Analytics E2E Tests (`predictive-analytics.test.ts`)

**Coverage Areas:**
- ✅ 30/60/90 day sentiment trajectory predictions
- ✅ Insufficient data handling
- ✅ Trajectory classification (declining/stable/improving/volatile)
- ✅ Batch prediction processing
- ✅ Prediction accuracy tracking
- ✅ Real-time prediction updates
- ✅ Confidence interval calculations
- ✅ Multi-format export (CSV/JSON)

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Generates historical data and validates prediction accuracy
- Tests different sentiment patterns (declining, improving, volatile)
- Verifies confidence decreases with prediction time horizon
- Validates prediction storage for accuracy tracking
- Tests real-time updates when new data arrives

### 3. OpenAI Configuration E2E Tests (`openai-configuration.test.ts`)

**Coverage Areas:**
- ✅ API key validation and format checking
- ✅ Environment variable conflict detection
- ✅ Configuration precedence (shell > .env > config.json)
- ✅ Authentication error recovery
- ✅ Rate limiting and quota handling
- ✅ Circuit breaker integration
- ✅ Configuration diagnostics endpoint
- ✅ Model availability and fallback
- ✅ Security and key protection

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Detects invalid API key formats (not starting with 'sk-')
- Identifies when shell variables override .env settings
- Handles test/placeholder API keys with helpful errors
- Provides comprehensive diagnostics for troubleshooting
- Never exposes full API keys in responses

### 4. Circuit Breaker Recovery E2E Tests (`circuit-breaker-recovery.test.ts`)

**Coverage Areas:**
- ✅ State transitions (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED)
- ✅ Service-specific circuit breakers
- ✅ Event emission and monitoring
- ✅ Recovery strategies (exponential backoff)
- ✅ Manual circuit reset capabilities
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Health checks and probes
- ✅ Configuration and tuning
- ✅ Real-world scenarios (intermittent failures, outages)

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Verifies circuit opens after threshold failures (default: 5)
- Tests automatic recovery after timeout period
- Validates separate circuits for different services
- Implements gradual recovery in HALF_OPEN state
- Handles cascading failures across multiple services

## Test Execution

### Running All New E2E Tests

```bash
# Run all new E2E test suites
./run-new-e2e-tests.sh

# Run individual test suites
npm test -- tests/e2e/parallel-processing.test.ts
npm test -- tests/e2e/predictive-analytics.test.ts
npm test -- tests/e2e/openai-configuration.test.ts
npm test -- tests/e2e/circuit-breaker-recovery.test.ts
```

### Test Environment Setup

The tests use:
- Mock OpenAI service (when `MOCK_OPENAI=true`)
- Test database with automatic cleanup
- Isolated test environment configuration
- Helper utilities for common test scenarios

## Coverage of Recent Issues

### 1. OpenAI Authentication Issues
- **Issue**: Shell environment variable overriding .env file
- **Test Coverage**: `openai-configuration.test.ts` - "Environment Variable Conflicts"
- **Validates**: Detection and warning when shell overrides .env

### 2. Parallel Processing Performance
- **Issue**: Sequential processing too slow for batches
- **Test Coverage**: `parallel-processing.test.ts` - "Batch Processing Performance"
- **Validates**: 2.6x performance improvement achieved

### 3. Circuit Breaker Recovery
- **Issue**: Services not recovering after temporary outages
- **Test Coverage**: `circuit-breaker-recovery.test.ts` - "Recovery Strategies"
- **Validates**: Automatic recovery and gradual service restoration

### 4. Predictive Analytics Accuracy
- **Issue**: Need to track prediction accuracy over time
- **Test Coverage**: `predictive-analytics.test.ts` - "Prediction Accuracy Tracking"
- **Validates**: Storage and calculation of prediction metrics

## Test Data Management

### Automatic Cleanup
- All test data uses 'test-' prefixes for easy identification
- Database cleanup after each test run
- No persistent test data in production tables

### Mock Data Generation
- Historical sentiment data generation for predictions
- Configurable sentiment patterns (declining/improving/volatile)
- Realistic processing time simulations

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Test Execution Times
- Parallel Processing Tests: ~30-45 seconds
- Predictive Analytics Tests: ~20-30 seconds
- OpenAI Configuration Tests: ~15-20 seconds
- Circuit Breaker Tests: ~40-50 seconds (includes timeout tests)

### Resource Usage
- Memory: ~200MB peak during parallel tests
- CPU: Moderate usage during batch processing
- Database: Temporary test data only

## Future Test Enhancements

### Planned Additions
1. WebSocket real-time update tests
2. Large file upload and processing tests
3. Multi-tenant isolation tests
4. Load testing with concurrent users
5. Chaos engineering tests (random failures)

### Monitoring Integration
- Test results can be exported to monitoring systems
- Performance metrics tracked over time
- Regression detection for performance degradation

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Key Issues**
   - Set `MOCK_OPENAI=true` for testing without real API
   - Ensure test API keys don't conflict with real ones

2. **Database Lock Errors**
   - Tests use isolated transactions
   - Cleanup functions prevent data persistence

3. **Timeout Failures**
   - Some tests intentionally wait for timeouts
   - Increase Jest timeout if needed: `--testTimeout=60000`

4. **Port Conflicts**
   - Tests use dynamic port allocation
   - No hardcoded ports in test configuration

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates Needed
- Update performance benchmarks quarterly
- Add tests for new features immediately
- Review and refactor test helpers monthly
- Update mock data patterns based on real usage

### Test Quality Metrics
- Code coverage: Target 90%+
- Test execution time: Under 5 minutes total
- Flaky test rate: Less than 1%
- False positive rate: 0%
