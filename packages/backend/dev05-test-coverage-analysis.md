# Dev05 Test Coverage Analysis

## Summary
Dev05 was responsible for API routes, WebSocket, SSE, and HTTP client services. Here's the analysis of their test coverage:

## 1. WebSocket Service
- **Implementation**: `src/services/websocket.service.ts` (416 lines)
- **Test Files**: 
  - `websocket.service.test.ts`
  - `websocket.service.basic.test.ts`  
  - `websocket.service.enhanced.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: 86.18% statements, 77.77% branches, 76.31% functions
- **Status**: ✅ GOOD COVERAGE
- **Issues**: Tests are failing due to Babel version conflict

## 2. SSE Service  
- **Implementation**: `src/services/sse.service.ts` (467 lines)
- **Test Files**: `sse.service.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: 96.68% statements, 69.69% branches, 92.85% functions
- **Status**: ✅ EXCELLENT COVERAGE
- **Issues**: Tests are failing due to Babel version conflict

## 3. API Client
- **Implementation**: `src/client/api-client.ts` (801 lines)
- **Test Files**:
  - `api-client.test.ts`
  - `api-client-fixed.test.ts`
  - `api-client-enhanced.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: 40.72% statements, 37.5% branches, 47.94% functions
- **Status**: ❌ POOR COVERAGE
- **Missing Coverage**: Many methods untested including:
  - File upload functionality
  - Real-time connection methods
  - Error handling scenarios
  - Batch operations

## 4. Route Tests
Dev05 was responsible for testing all route files. Analysis shows:

### Routes with Tests ✅
- `auth.routes.ts` - 2 test files
- `dashboard.routes.ts` - 8 test files (excessive)
- `data.routes.ts` - 2 test files
- `health.routes.ts` - 1 test file

### Routes WITHOUT Tests ❌
- `analytics.routes.ts`
- `cache.routes.ts`
- `circuit-breaker.routes.ts`
- `compliance.routes.ts`
- `config.routes.ts`
- `connection-status.routes.ts`
- `export.routes.ts`
- `jobs.routes.ts`
- `monitoring.routes.ts`
- `openai.routes.ts`
- `patterns.routes.ts`
- `redis-queue.routes.ts`
- `risk-assessment.routes.ts`
- `secrets.routes.ts`
- `security.routes.ts`
- `sentiment.routes.ts`
- `sse.routes.ts`
- `stream.routes.ts`
- `transform.routes.ts`
- `websocket.routes.ts`

## Blocking Issues

1. **Babel Version Conflict**: All tests are failing with:
   ```
   Requires Babel "^7.22.0 || >8.0.0-alpha <8.0.0-beta", but was loaded with "7.21.8"
   ```
   This prevents any tests from running properly.

2. **Duplicate Mock Files**: Multiple warnings about duplicate mocks in dist/ and src/ directories

## Conclusion

Dev05 has implemented test files for their core services (WebSocket, SSE, API Client) but:
- Only 4 out of 24 route files have tests (17% coverage)
- API Client has poor test coverage (40%)
- All tests are currently failing due to environment issues
- The claimed "100% completion" is inaccurate

### Actual Completion: ~35%
- WebSocket Service: 90% complete
- SSE Service: 95% complete  
- API Client: 40% complete
- Route Tests: 17% complete
