## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Timeouts**: Dev01 priority fix, fallback to lighter test DBs
- **Redis Integration**: Dev04 priority fix, fallback to memory cache
- **External API Dependencies**: Mock all external calls, add contract tests
- **Test Performance**: Optimize slow tests, parallelize where possible

### Resource Risks  
- **Time Constraints**: Focus on critical path services first
- **Dependency Blocking**: Clear escalation path for blockers
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Pair programming and knowledge sharing sessions

### Quality Risks
- **Coverage Gaming**: Focus on meaningful tests, not just coverage numbers
- **Test Maintenance**: Build sustainable test patterns
- **Integration Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally

---

## Tools & Environment

### Required Tools
- Jest (testing framework)
- Supertest (API testing)  
- Coverage reporting (istanbul)
- Docker (for integration testing)
- TypeScript (full type checking)

### Development Standards
- **Test Naming**: Descriptive behavior-driven names
- **File Structure**: Co-locate tests with source files
- **Mock Strategy**: Use dependency injection, avoid global mocks
- **Data Management**: Use factories, avoid hardcoded test data

### Monitoring & Reporting
- Daily coverage reports
- Test performance tracking
- Failure rate monitoring
- Integration test stability metrics
