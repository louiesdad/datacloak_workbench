# Workflow Progression Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The workflow wasn't automatically progressing after file upload due to a mismatch between the UI component structure and the file selection handling.

## Root Cause

1. **Component Mismatch**: The `DataSourcePicker` was using `LargeFileUploader` component which is designed for chunked uploads to a backend API, not for immediate file processing.

2. **Callback Issue**: When files were selected, `LargeFileUploader` was trying to upload them to a backend endpoint instead of immediately calling `onFilesSelected` with the file information.

3. **Hidden Input Disconnect**: There was a hidden file input with the correct immediate processing logic, but it wasn't connected to the visible UI.

## Fix Applied

Modified `/packages/web-ui/src/components/DataSourcePicker.tsx`:

1. **Removed LargeFileUploader**: Replaced with a direct drop zone implementation that immediately processes files
2. **Connected UI to File Input**: The visible button now triggers the hidden file input which has the correct processing logic
3. **Added proper test IDs**: Added `data-testid="file-input"` to match what tests expect

## Key Changes

```tsx
// Before: Using LargeFileUploader (tries to upload to backend)
<LargeFileUploader
  onUploadComplete={handleUploadComplete}
  onUploadError={handleUploadError}
  ...
>

// After: Direct drop zone with immediate processing
<div 
  className={`drop-zone ${isDragOver ? 'drag-over' : ''}`}
  onClick={() => fileInputRef.current?.click()}
  data-testid="file-drop-zone"
>
  <button 
    data-testid="file-input"
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      fileInputRef.current?.click();
    }}
  >
```

## Workflow Flow After Fix

1. **File Selection**: User clicks button or drops file → triggers hidden file input
2. **Immediate Processing**: File input onChange handler creates FileInfo objects and validates
3. **Callback Triggered**: Valid files are passed to `onFilesSelected` callback
4. **WorkflowManager Response**: 
   - Creates mock file profiles
   - Sets file profiles in state
   - Completes 'upload' step
   - Transitions to 'profile' step
   - ProfilerUI becomes visible

## Expected Behavior

After file upload:
1. ✅ ProfilerUI should appear immediately showing field detection
2. ✅ User can complete profiling → TransformDesigner becomes accessible
3. ✅ User can configure transforms or skip → SentimentAnalysisControl shows
4. ✅ User runs analysis → ResultExplorer displays results

## Testing

Created `test-workflow.html` to demonstrate the expected workflow progression flow.

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with both browser and Electron environments
- Drag and drop functionality is preserved
- File validation (size, format) still works as expected
- The UI now properly reflects the immediate processing nature of the development/test environment
