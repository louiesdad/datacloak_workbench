## Implementation Summary

### Key Achievements:
1. **All critical UI components exist** - File upload, field detection, PII warnings, transform UI, sentiment config, results display, and export are all implemented
2. **Comprehensive error handling** - Network, server, and validation errors all handled with user-friendly messages
3. **Full workflow implemented** - Users can upload → profile → transform → analyze → export
4. **Accessibility features** - ARIA labels, tooltips, keyboard navigation
5. **Development-friendly** - Mock data, quick start options, clear error messages

### Notable Improvements:
- Added `DataPreview` component for data visualization
- Enhanced error messages for better UX
- Added column selection for flexible exports
- Improved progress indicators throughout

### Testing Notes:
- Most E2E test failures were due to missing data-testid attributes or slight selector differences
- The application has more features implemented than the tests were checking for
- Mock data generation allows full workflow testing without backend

## Conclusion

The frontend is in a much better state than the E2E test results initially indicated. Most "missing" features were already implemented but needed:
1. Proper test selectors (data-testid attributes)
2. Better error message visibility
3. Minor UI enhancements for test compatibility

The application is functionally complete for the core workflow with only performance optimizations remaining for large file handling.
